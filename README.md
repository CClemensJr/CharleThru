Welcome to the CharleThru app!

The purpose of this app is to assist job seekers with keeping track of the jobs
they have applied for as well as be served with reminders to follow up with
employers after an application has been submitted. Diligent use of this app will
ensure that each employer is contacted multiple times, increasing the odds of
getting an interview
